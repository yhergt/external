<h1 style="text-align:center;color:red;">Chaos Insurgency Operations in South America</h1>
<p>The South American continent is a major hub for Insurgency operations. In the past, a widespread absence of Foundation operations on the continent and widespread political instability meant that
South America became home to dozens of Insurgency military outposts, most of which focused on Alpha-class personnel recruitment. Since the 1990's, Insurgency operations on the continent have
steadily decreased thanks to a more stable political environment and increased prescence of Foundation MTFs. Nevertheless, the Insurgency still operates military outposts in Caracas, Bogota, the Darien Gap, Manaus, and Montevideo.
The Insurgency's R&D division also operates heavily in South America, in large part thanks to the isolated nature of regions such as the Amazon rainforest and the Andes mountains. Despite not having large prescences of
personnel from the Insurgency's military wing, these facilities are still armed to the teeth with both conventional weaponry and paratechnological weapons. This, combined with the logistical difficulties of such an operation,
means that it is nearly impossible to mount assaults on these facilities.</p>
