<h4>Item #:███33
<h4>Object Class: Euclid</h4>
<h4>Special Containment Procedures:</h4>
<p>SCP-██33 is to be kept within a standard vehicle storage garage. SCP-███33 may not be removed from containment or be fuelled except for testing. For safety reasons, only personnel of Catholic faith
are permitted within 50m of SCP-███33 once fuelled. The land around SCP-███33-2 has been purchased by the Foundation and is closed off to the public under Cover Story 74 ("Private Property").</p>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>SCP-███33 is an M1 Abrams main battle tank. Visually, SCP-███33 displays no aberrations from a typical M1 Abrams main battle tank. Notably, all serial numbers on SCP-███33's components match those used in ████████████, an M1 Abrams destroyed
in 1991 during the Gulf War. Components on the underside of SCP-██33 roughly form the shape of a cross, although this does not appear to have any effect on the vehicle's operation. The interior is roughly consistent with other
M1 Abrams main battle tanks manufactured during the 1990s, albeit covered with examples of Catholic imagery and corporate advertising for Honda. The phrase "Jesus Takes the Wheel" occurs frequently within SCP-███33. SCP-███33's
main anamalous property is its fuel source. SCP-███33 only runs on a fluid similar in composition to water from the Jordan River in composition and debris present, and can not be fuelled through any conventional methods. Fuelling SCP-███33 is only possible
by praying in proximity to or within it, or by making donations to SCP-███33-2. Once fuelled, SCP-███33 can be operated similarly to a normal tank; however, it may sometimes perform actions outside of the operators' control. 
These usually consist acts of agression towards non-Catholics; for more information, consult the Experiment Log.</p>
<p>SCP-███33-2 is a church in █████████, Utah. SCP-██33-2 resembles churches typical of its region. However, a single wooden box labelled "Donations"
 is present within the entrance to SCP-██33-2. This box is fused to the floor of SCP-██33-2 and has, to date, resisted all attempts to open, relocate or destroy it. A small slit 5x1cm in size is present on the top face
of the box; when American currency is inserted, SCP-██33 is fuelled. Insertion of other items appears to have no effect. While locals claim that SCP-██33-2 was constructed in 18██, analysis of SCP-██33-2's construction produces an
age of 2,0██ years. Investigation is ongoing.</p>
