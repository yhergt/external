<h1>NOTICE FROM THE RECORDKEEPING AND INFORMATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p style="font-size:130%;">The following document may contain text-based infohazards and cognitohazards. All personnel viewing this file must be innoculated for memetic hazards and report to their HMCL supervisor for antimeme treatment upon closing this document.</p>
</div>
<h4>Item #: ████ </h4>
<h4>Object Class: <del>Pending</del> <del>Euclid</del> Keter
<h4>Special Containment Procedures:</h4>
<p>SCP-████ is to be kept within a <del>standard 3x3x3m storage container</del> <span style="color:blue">3x3x3m airtight steel chamber constantly pressurized to 3,500 hPa with chlorine gas</span> within Armed Bio-Containment Area-14. <del>All personnel interacting with SCP-███ must don standard biohazard protection gear</del> <span style="color:blue">No interaction with SCP-████ is permitted unless absolutely necessary</span>. SCP-███ may not be removed from its chamber <del>unless it is being removed for testing, with prior clearance from Level 5 personnel.</del> All documentation of SCP-████ should be held on secure external SCiPNet servers to prevent proliferation of memetic hazards.
<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>SCP-████ is a 2006 Honda Civic. Notably, SCP-████ is devoid of all forms of identification (serial numbers, license plates, etc.) SCP-████'s <del>only</del> <span style="color:blue">primary</span> anamalous property is its ability to manifest high quantities of <i>Bacillus Anthracis</i> (Anthrax) bacteria on its surface. The bacteria generated by SCP-████ are able to regenerate at extremely high rates. Bacteria on its surface has been noted to regenerate to lethal levels within ten minutes of total sterilization of SCP-████. <span style="color:blue">SCP-████ also has the ability to generate memetic hazards and either memetically transmit said hazards into the conciousness of attackers or cause the appearance of said memes on its surface as a form of defense. As of 20██-5-11, SCP-████ has been constantly using this defense mechanism for the past 2██ days.<span></p>
<h4>Addendum - Incident 9/5/███</h4>
<p>On September 5, 20██ an attempt was made by Area-14 personnel to neutralize SCP-████. SCP-████ was transported by D-Class personnel to the Area's incinerator. Upon arrival at the incinerator, SCP-████ activated its defense mechanism. ████████ ████ ████████████ killed ███ Area-14 security personnel by ████████ ██████████ neural functions. Upon recontainment, SCP-████ memetically transmitted the following message:</p>
<div class="comms">
<p>Biology of target subjects incompatible with mission objective. You are exempt from salvation.</p>
</div>
<h4>Addendum - SCP-████-2</h4>
<div class="raisa">
<h1>WARNING</h1>
<p style="font-size: 130%">The following documentation is only open to level 5/████ personnel. Scrolling further will result in your exposure to a VALKYRIE class cognitohazard tuned to induce cardiac arrest in personnel with insufficient clearance. By continuing you are confirming that you have been innoculated for this cognitohazard and are cleared to view the document.</p>
