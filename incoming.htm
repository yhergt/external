<p>FROM: OVERSEER_1</p>
<p>TO: OVERSEER_13</p>
<p>Hello Overseer 13,</p>
<p>Apologies for the interruption. However, you are urgently needed by the council, and by extension, the rest of the Foundation. Recently, the location of various sites was leaked to a hostile GOI,
most likely the Insurgency; this list included the likes of Site-17, Site-9, Area-14 and Overwatch Command. Overwatch Command came under siege before any of us could evacuate. The Council is currently drafting a number of proposals on
how to solve the situation, but have come to a standstill on all of them. This is where you come in. As per protocol, you will use your vote as a tiebreaker on our resolutions. And since you are (presumably) not located
at Overwatch Command, should our efforts fail, you will be able to execute our contingency plans should the rest of the Council be neutralized. Good luck, Overseer. May fate see you overcome all.</p>
<p>Signed, O5-1</p>
