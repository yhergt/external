<h4>Special Containment Procedures:</h4>
<p>SCP-████-2 is currently outside the logistical and technical capability for the Foundation to contain. Efforts are currently focused on preventing the public
and Foundation from discovering the true nature of SCP-████-2. Foundation webcrawlers are to purge all data pertaining to SCP-████-2 from public scientific
databases. If necessary, agents embedded within the scientific community may be deployed to purge knowledge as necessary; however, said agents must be amnesticized
upon completion of their missions. In order to prevent knowledge of SCP-████-2 by Foundation personnel, all data pertaining to SCP-████-2 must be stored on secure
external servers protected by memetic countermeasures.</p>

<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>SCP-████-2 is an object of extrasolar origin located ██ ly away from the Earth as of 202█-█-█. SCP-████-2 is a sphere of unknown construction, measuring approx.
20m in diameter. SCP-████-2 is currently traveling towards the Earth on an impact trajectory at 99.98357% of the speed of light; impact is estimated for 
205█-██-██. Upon impact with the Earth, SCP-████-2 will cause an XK-Class End-of-the-world scenario with effects including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating an impact crater 5██km wide by 6km deep at the side of impact</li>
<li>Raising of the atmospheric temperature by 4██ degrees Celcius.</li>
<li>Disabling or destroying the majority of Thaumiel-class anamolies.</li>
<li>Immediate eradication of the Foundation, and all life on Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Addendum - Discovery</h4>
<p>SCP-████-2 was discovered on 20██-9-18, when SCP-████ broadcasted a radio signal skyward for a total of 155 seconds. Foundation scientists were able to locate the intended
destination of the broadcast, revealing the prescence of SCP-████-2. Further investigation revealed its nature as an Apollyon-class threat; the current containment measures were
established and all personnel involved in the discovery of SCP-████-2 below Level 5 clearance were amnesticized. A transcript of SCP-████'s broadcast can be found in Addendum 3.</p>

<h4>Addendum - Measures for neutralization</h4>
<p>Following the classification of SCP-████-2 as Apollyon-class, a joint meeting of the O5 Council was convened on 20██-10-03. A number of proposals on how to neutralize
SCP-████-2 were proposed, listed below.</p>
<ul style="color:cyan">
<li>Destruction of SCP-████-2 with orbital-based weaponry [REJECTED - The Foundation does not possess the technical abilities to neutralize SCP-████-2, and there is no guarantee
that the Foundation will possess these abilities before the impact date.]</li>
<li>Destruction of SCP-████ in order to neutralize SCP-████-2's targeting systems. [REJECTED - SCP-████-2 appears to be an unguided projectile. The Foundation also does not posess
the capability to neutralize SCP-████.]</li>
<li>Usage of SCP-2000 post-impact to repopulate the Earth. [REJECTED - There is no guarantee SCP-2000 would survive impact. SCP-2000 also does not have the capabilities for
environmental restoration necessary after such an event.]</li>
<li>Redirecting the Earth's orbit to avoid the trajectory of SCP-████-2. [REJECTED - Unfeasible.]</li>
<li>Mass evacuation of the Earth's population. [REJECTED - The Foundation does not have the logistical capabilities to perform this task. Doing so would also result in a LK-Class
"Broken Masquerade" scenario.]</li>
<li>Evacuation of the O5 Council and other level 5 personnel from Earth. [APPROVED - Construction of ships to transport SCP Foundation peronnnel to SITE-DAEDALUS underway.
Evacuations to commence 203█-██-██.]</li>
