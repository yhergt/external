<p>North America was the birthplace of the Insurgency. Despite this, the Insurgency's prescence here is somewhat limited due to the pervasiveness of Foundation operations on the continent. Most Insurgency operations here
consist of safehouses within major urban centers from which strike teams operate. These strike teams mainly focus on disrupting Foundation logistics, intercepting convoys and raiding stockpiles, but also occasionally
launch raids against Foundation facilities. These raids were once commonplace, but increased prescence of MTFs in North America, escpecially NU-7 "Hammer Down" have made raiding largely unfeasible. The main bases of Insurgency
operation in North America are located in Anchorage, Seattle, San Diego, Mexico City, Winnipeg, Chicago, Toronto, New Orleans, Boston and Miami.</p>
