<h1 style="text-align:center;color:red;">Chaos Insurgency Operations in Africa and the Middle East</h1>
<p>The Middle East as a hub for Insurgency activity. The highly unstable political situation and poor living conditions provide a large base of Alpha-class recruits, while a lack of widespread operations from any major opposing GOI
means that operations here are safe from prying eyes. However, the region's instability is a double edged sword. Any long-term static facility, no matter how covert,
is likely to be compromised within a relatively short timeframe. For this reason, the Insurgency does not operate any major research facilities in the Middle East. The main bases of Insurgency operation in the Middle East are
Cairo, Aleppo, Baghdad and Tehran.</p>

<p>The Insurgency also has widespread operations in Africa for much of the same reason as its operation in the Middle East. However, operations in Africa also have the advantage of there being a wide multitude of remote regions
in which research facilities can operate without fear of intervention. The main bases for the Insurgency's military wing are in Tripoli, Banjul, Lagos, Pointe-Noire and Johannesburg. The main Insurgecny research facilities are located
in the Sahara Desert in Mali, Niger and Chad, and in the eastern regions of the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
