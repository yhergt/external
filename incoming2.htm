<p>FROM: ADMINISTRATOR</p>
<p>TO: OVERSEER_13</p>
<p>Congratulations, Overseer.</p>
<p>We've finally managed to drive back the attackers from our facilities, in no small part thanks to your actions. Unfortunately, a number of O5 Council members were incapacitated during the atttacks. As a result,
promotions are being handed out all across the Foundation, and you're one of the ones slated to be promoted - to the head of the council, no less.</p>
<p>Show up to Overwatch Command for your promotion. That's an order.</p>
<p>Signed, The Administrator</p>
