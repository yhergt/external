<h1 style="text-align:center;color:red;">Chaos Insurgency Operations in Asia and Oceania</h1>
<p>The Insurgency has a significant prescence in Asia. The main bases for Insurgency research operations are located within Central Asia and Siberia, within abandoned GRU-P facilities. In constrast, the Insurgency's military wing
does not have a major military prescence. India, China, and the United States are among the strongest signatories of the Foundation Charter by military strength and are actively hostile to the Insurgency, making Alpha-class
recruitment, the most common mission of the military wing difficult. Instead, the Insurgency's facilities are operated purely as safehouses and firebases. The main bases for Insurgent operation are within the Himalayan mountains
and their foothills, escpecially within Southeast Asia.</p>

<p>Notably, the Insurgency does not have any major operations in Oceania. Both Australia and New Zealand, as signatories of the Foundation Charter and supporting members of the Global Occult Coalition, are hostile to the Insurgency.
Some rumors circulate of the Insurgency operating on islands in the Pacific Ocean, but as of the time of writing both reconnisance and espionage have failed to confirm these claims.</p>
