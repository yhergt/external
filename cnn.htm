<h4 style="font-family:calibri;font-size:150%;">WASHINGTON, D.C.</h4>
<p>Earlier today, President Biden delivered an official statement declaring that the United States is in a state of war against the Russian Federation. Similar declarations have been made by most
other member nations of NATO, including the United Kingdom, France and Germany. These events come after a series of unexplained nuclear explosions on American soil, in Alaska, Washington state,
New Mexico, and Nevada, among other locations. During his speech, President Biden blamed Russia for the explosions, calling it "a cowardly attempt at a preemptive strike" and stating that the American
military would retaliate in full force. </p>
<p>Reactions to Biden's message have been mixed across America. Some have praised Biden for finally talking action, escpecially in the Ukrainian-American community. Others have had a more negative
reaction, accusing Biden of dragging America into a nuclear war. Indeed, many people have begun panic buying, with many on social media expressing fear of a nuclear war. These threats may
not be unfounded, as a number of reports state that both the United States's missile silos and nuclear submarines have been put on high alert and told to be ready to engage at any moment.</p>
